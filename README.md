## Description
I had major problems with Git while working on this assignment. Last night, I met with a tutor and she helped me get past it (for some reason I was stuck in the Develop branch from Run Buddy and my SSH key was not working at all). While Git was not letting me push my commits on this weekly challenge, I kept working on it because I didn't want to fall behind. But this means that I will get a poor score on this assignment's requirements to show a history of Git commits following best practices. Sorry! Now that Git is fixed I can do much better on the next assignment. It was working great for the Run Buddy work, but then something went wrong with the SSH keys and it wouldn't let me push or pull anything. Thanks to the tutoring session though, I'm on track. Onward! Thank you for your time in scoring this assignment.
